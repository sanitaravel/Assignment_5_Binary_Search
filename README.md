# CS Programming | TypeScript Unit Tests Boilerplate

## On first run
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Running the project
The entrypoint for this project is `main.ts`. Run it with `npm start`.

## Running the tests
Run the tests with `npm test`. It will run all files called `*.test.ts` (e.g. `main.test.ts`, `utils.test.ts`).

This script will also run in watch mode, which means it will re-run the tests every time you save a file.
